# DecorPlanet Ecommerce website
The "DecorPlanet" project is a robust full-stack e-commerce application tailored specifically for   purchasing home decoration products, furniture and other home essentials. Through the amalgamation of React on the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MongoDB as the persistent database, we've engineered a fluid shopping experience. Furthermore, we've integrated DevOps methodologies, embracing Docker for containerization and GitHub Actions to automate the CI/CD pipeline.
